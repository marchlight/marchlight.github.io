	Hi FWR first years! Sorry about the stressful conditions you're dealing with right now. I'm working on this page 
	to help you study for your lab exam, and don't worry, you're going to ace it! Right now the page is pretty broken and 
	you'll see a lot of broken images and such. I'm working as fast as I can outside of my real-life job to get this up 
	and running. It should be ready to go by Thursday or Friday this week. Happy studying, and stay home and healthy!<br /><br />
	
	Mar 24 - updates to mammals and added some fish. I'm working off 2 year old printed notes, so some things may have 
	changed or I may have typed them in wrong. Please contact me at info@wildginger.ca if you see any errors or if you 
	have any suggestions for how I can make this tool better suit your class.

	Hi FWR first years! Sorry about the stressful conditions you're dealing with right now. I hope this page helps. I updated
	it to be closer to your lab exam than the Wildlife page. That said, I don't have a ton of time to test the page and I'm	
	going off my old handouts so some things may be outdated. Please contact me at info@wildginger.ca if you see any errors or if you 
	have any suggestions for how I can make this tool better suit your class. Happy studying, and stay home and healthy!<br /><br />

	<div class="option">
		<a class="link" href="comprehensive.html">Comprehensive Test</a><br /><br />
		Learn everything about everything until you're done all the things!
	</div>

	<div class="option">
		<a class="link" href="labexam.html">Practice Lab Exam</a><br /><br />
		Practice questions in the lab exam style. Questions are random, and the test goes on forever (answers aren't removed when you get them right).
